Project using Arduino and CC1101 SDR to display the tyre pressures transmitted at 387-464MHz by the tyres sensors (based on Toyota TPMS project).
## Intent:
- Porting the code to ESP32.üëç![GoodNightSweetDreamsGIF](https://github.com/avicarmeli/TPMS-SDR/assets/32562196/97d3e690-da3d-4af3-88de-07ff123223a1)



- Sending sensors data over BLE to imitate Sysgration BLE sensors so it can be displayed in cellphone app.
