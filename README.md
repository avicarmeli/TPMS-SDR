# TPMS Arduino code to read RF Tpms Sensors
Project using Arduino and CC1101 SDR to display the tyre pressures transmitted at 387-464MHz by the tyres sensors (based on Toyota TPMS project).
## Intent:
- Porting the code to ESP32.


- Sending sensors data over BLE to imitate Sysgration BLE sensors so it can be displayed in cellphone app.
