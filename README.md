# TPMS Arduino code to read RF Tpms Sensors
Project using Arduino and CC1101 to display the tyre pressures transmitted at 387-464MHz by the tyres sensors (based on Toyota TPMS project).
This Fork is aimed on porting the code to ESP32 and sending sensors data over BLE to imitate Sysgration BLE sensors so it can be displayed in cellphone app.
